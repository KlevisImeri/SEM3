3.
The lab report is a PDF file. Do we have a prepared PDF file that tells the structure or we are making the lab report from scratch?

4.
Is it possible to have the Username and Password before the lab so we can be prepared better for the lab exercises?

I am asking because `4. Oracle administration` in the `oracle.pdf` file what we need to prepare for the lab is based in the idea that we are already connected to a database.
I may be wrong but without the Username or Password I can't:
-  Look at sessions data
-  Look at locks data
-  Create Objects
-  Managing the Users in DBA
-  DBA mode Security or Storage
