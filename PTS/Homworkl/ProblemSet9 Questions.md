1. When you say to give a Linear Regression Line should we give a line equation or should be give how Random Variables depend with each other. For example 1c should we give $X_2+X_3=\frac{1}{2}(X_{1}+X_{2})$ or $y=x/2$ .In the other exercises we give the regression line as a set. I just don't get what a regression line is.
2. For exercise 2 should we use the moment generating function or is there a trick.
3. My calculations for 2c: $x_3$ means $E(X_3)$

But the values are not even close.
3. for exercise 3 what is the meaning behind it. What was the point of it accept the calculations and definitions.
4. Is the exercise 6 just doing the integral for everything or is there a trick to simplify.
5. When you find $F_{X|Y}$ how are the regions defined. Do we only give the region where the function is 0<F<1 and we don't care where it is equal to 1 or 0 or we should also write these two regions. If yes how?
