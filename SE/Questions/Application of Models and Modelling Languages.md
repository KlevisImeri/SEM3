What is required to define a language? #flashcard 
- Syntax: the rules 
- Semantics: the meaning 
<!--ID: 1702670609826-->


What are the kind of syntaxes for modeling languages? #flashcard 
Abstract:
- Elements
- Grammatical Rules (relation)
- "Metamodel"
Concrete:
- Textual | graphical (How to represent them)
- You can use different ones 
<!--ID: 1702670609833-->


For defining good rules what else do you need? #flashcard 
- Well-formedness rules 
	- Telling how to use the syntax correctly without errors
> The syntax only tell you how to show the relation
> but this shows exacly the minute details on how write correctly.

Use English for example of defining a modelling language? #flashcard 
Example: English
Abstract Syntax: 
	- name... element
	- verb... element
	- name before verb ... (relation Grammatical rule)
Concrete Syntax:
	- Text 
	- One after each other
Well-formedness rules:
	- A name should start with Uppercase letter ...
<!--ID: 1702670609847-->



What are semantics and types of it? #flashcard 
- Declarative: what it is r
- Operational: what it does 
<!--ID: 1702670609853-->


What if you need a special language for something? #flashcard 
You use Domain Specific Languages
