What is a metric?
What are software metric? #flashcard 
Quantifiable and Objective measurement for a system.
Measurements that can be quantified about the software development process.
> Objective means exactly measurable (like with numbers and not opinions)
<!--ID: 1702652057722-->


What is Quality?
What is the Standard used to Measure it? #flashcard 
How much does the software meets the requirements and user expectation.
ISO 9126:
1. Functionality
2. Reliability
3. Usability
4. Efficiency
5. Maintainability
6. Portability
<!--ID: 1702652057729-->


Tell the level of Metrics? #flashcard 
- Source code metrics
- Test metrics
- Run-time metrics
- Metrics related to the development process
- Metrics related to the complete operation
<!--ID: 1702652057735-->

Evaluation of:
- Quality 
- Targeted Checking
<!--ID: 1702652057741-->


What is Targeted Checking?
Why does it support verification? #flashcard 
- Examine particular parts. 
<!--ID: 1702652057747-->


What is the diff between Verification and Validation? #flashcard 
- Verification : Does it satisfy the requirements (LAB)
- Validation : Is is the product wanted but the stakeholders (ENVIRONMENT)

Turn this code to Control Flow:
```cpp
while (a != b) { 
	if (a > b) { 
		a = a – b; 
	} else { 
	b = b – a; 
	} 
} 
return a;
```
Explain Cyclomatic Complexity? #flashcard 
![](Pasted%20image%2020231215010358.png)
It is M=E-N+2p | p # of starting nodes
- E-N+1 tells you how many more branchings.
- +2 so it starts from 1
<!--ID: 1702652058920-->


What are further Structural Metrics? #flashcard 
- Deepest embedded control structure
- Knots : # of parallel branches
- Comment-to-Code ratio
- LoC
<!--ID: 1702652058927-->


What is a project and should it have well defined? #flashcard 
- Managed Set:={{activity, resource},...} 
- Set.produce() == (product || service)
It has:
- Starts 
- End
- Goal
- Responsible
- Team
