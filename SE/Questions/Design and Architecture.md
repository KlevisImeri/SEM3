What is architecture? #flashcard 
- The design of the structure of the system.

What makes a good architecture? #flashcard 
- Clarifying Complexity
- Adaptable (to new requirements | conditions)
- Extensible (add new features easily)
<!--ID: 1702905262414-->

What are software architectural styles? 
List the software architecture styles? #flashcard 
An architecture with specialized elements and constrains.
- General Structures (Layers, Pipes, Filters)
- Distributed Systems (Client-Server, Micro Services)
- Interactive Systems (MVC)
<!--ID: 1702905262434-->


What is the diff between Monolith and Microservice architecture style? #flashcard 
- Microservice are distributed which means you have component which are loosely coupled.

- Many databases (for backup)
- Cashes
