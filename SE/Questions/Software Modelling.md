List some Modelling Languages? #flashcard 
- Final state machines
- Verilog
- Graphs
- Flow Charts
- E-R diagrams
- Class diagrams 

Why is Verilog a modelling language? #flashcard 
- Verilog doesn't have 1-to-1 instructions with the hardware. It doesn't even care about it. It just describes how Verilog modules interact and then produces the specific hardware.

What is a model? #flashcard 
- abstracted (simplified) description of the system (real world) which can be views from different viewpoints (angles)

What is the diff between the Scientific vs Engineering models? #flashcard 
- Understand the system | Scientific 
- Design the system | Engineering 

What is the opposite of abstraction? #flashcard 
- Refinement

What are the types or refinement? #flashcard 
- Hierarchical 
- Set refinement
