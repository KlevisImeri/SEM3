### Code Review
- **Code Readability:**
    - The code lacks readability with no separation into smaller parts or helper functions.
    - Consider breaking down the code into smaller, logical segments and introducing meaningful helper functions.
- **Maintainability:**
    - Due to the code's poor readability, maintainability is severely impacted.
    - Enhance the code structure for better comprehension, add comments for complex sections, and maintain a consistent coding style.
- **Performance:**    
    - No performance review will be provided initially due to the code's unreadable and unmaintainable nature.
    - Prioritize improving readability first to pave the way for future performance enhancements.
- **Application of Accepted Programming Patterns, Practices:**
    - No review will be given initially for adherence to programming patterns and practices, given the code's current unreadable and unmaintainable state.

### Testing Summary
> [!Error] Tests run: 16, Failures: 4, Errors: 1, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.326 s <<< FAILURE!

Four tests failed, and one encountered an error during execution.

**Test Failures:**
1. **Test 1: Simple Merge Failure**
   - The merge function failed to execute a basic merge.
   - **Input:**
     ```
     .__.__.
     .__.__.
     
     ```
     **Expected Output:**
     ```
     .__*__.
     ._/ \_.
     ```

3. **Test 3: Incorrect Merge**
   - The merge function did not perform the merge correctly.
   - **Input:**
     ```
     .__*__.
     ._/ \_.
     
     *==*__.
         \_.
     ```
     **Expected Output:**
     ```
     .______*______.
     ._____/ \_____.
     *===//   \__.
               \_.
     ```

5. **Test 5: Incorrect Merge for Adjacent Stops**
   - The merge function erroneously performed a merge when stops were adjacent.

6. **Test 6: Incorrect Merge for Minimum Stops**
   - The merge function incorrectly executed a merge with fewer than two stops on each line.

**Error in Test 14:**
- **Test 14: Incorrect Exception Handling**
  - The test encountered an error due to an unexpected `IllegalArgumentException` for the case of no lines serving both stations.
  - The specification does not specify returning an exception; instead, it states that nothing should occur.

Please review and address these issues regarding the merge function for improved functionality and adherence to specifications.
